# ✅ To-Do List Manager

A simple console-based Java application to manage daily tasks.

## 🧠 What It Does
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks (with completion status and due date)
- Remove tasks by name
- Input validation for user input

## 🚀 Features
- Uses a `Task` class to represent each task
- Stores tasks in an `ArrayList<Task>`
- Uses `LocalDate` for due dates
- Accepts user input through `Scanner`
- Clean task display with `toString()`

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- java.util.Scanner
- java.util.ArrayList
- java.time.LocalDate

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Open in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse)
2. Run `Main.java`
3. Follow the prompts in the console

## 📚 What I Learned
- Deeper understanding of encapsulation and object modeling
- Parsing and validating dates (`LocalDate.parse`)
- Removing objects from a list using `.equalsIgnoreCase`
- Clean separation of concerns between logic and data

## 📅 Project Level
🔵 **Level 3** — Introduced `LocalDate`, refined object handling, and better user input validation.
